Registration App

This Registration App is developed using Android Studio with Java and Firebase, designed to provide a seamless user authentication experience. The app allows users to register and log in securely using Firebase Authentication. The registration process collects essential user information, including email and password, which is stored securely in Firebase's Realtime Database.

Key features include:

User Registration: New users can easily create an account by providing their email and password, which are authenticated through Firebase.
Secure Login: Registered users can log in to the app securely, with their credentials verified against Firebase's authentication system.
Password Recovery: The app includes a password recovery feature, enabling users to reset their password via email in case they forget it.
Firebase Integration: All user data is securely managed and stored in Firebase, ensuring data integrity and real-time synchronization.
This app serves as a robust foundation for any application requiring user authentication, providing a secure and user-friendly interface for managing user accounts.
